# LSTM-Forecasting
**Forecasting Mars Dust Storms**

**Overview**

This notebook formulates a forecasting model using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to forecast features that influence the dust storms on Mars using the data available from Mars Science Laboratory Mission (MSL) in Gale Crater.

**Installation**
To run this notebook the data set is the only material required. The file containing data set is provided along with the notebook. It is also available in my GitHub profile along with the complete code. I have provided the link to the data set in the data section.

**Usage**

The project is written in python. I have written this notebook in a straightforward and concise manner. The code can be run on any platform supporting python. It may require you to install some libraries depending on the platform you are using.

**Data**

The data set used in this project is Mars weather data from Mars Science Laboratory Mission. Raw and processed data is provided by Planetary Data System which is a data archive of data products from all NASA’s planetary missions. I have also used data from USRA Houston Repository which provides the processed data. I have collected data from these data providers and combined it into a comma separated values format for this project.
